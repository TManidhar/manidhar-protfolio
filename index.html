  <h1>Me</h1>
  <p >I am Manidhar Terapalli, a passionate and ambitious 2nd-year BSc Computer Science student with a deep interest in both
  technology and creative fields. I developed a web-based search engine called Community Connector without using Google,
  which reflects my innovation and problem-solving skills. I have also completed an animation project and earned
  certificates in Photoshop, app design, and the National Career Service Program (NCSP). My curiosity about artificial
  intelligence led me to complete the "Introduction to AI" course from Great Learning. I secured 1st rank in a physics
  working model competition and participated in a science fair, which helped me build both academic and practical
  knowledge. Currently, I’m working as an HR intern at TEN – The Entrepreneurship Nation, which is my first internship. I
  consider myself a creative, determined person who is always eager to learn and grow.</p>
